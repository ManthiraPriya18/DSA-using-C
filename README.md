#  Data Structures & Algorithms in C

This repository contains my handwritten implementations of various **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** in the **C programming language**. These files reflect my learning and practice while building a strong foundation in problem-solving, algorithm design, and core programming principles.



##  Topics Covered

- Arrays
- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- Stacks and Queues (using Arrays and Linked Lists)
- Trees (Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree)
- Sorting Algorithms (Bubble, Insertion, Selection, Merge, Quick)
- Searching Algorithms (Linear, Binary)
- Recursion
- Pointers and Memory Management
- Hashing (Basics)

##  Why C?

C provides a low-level view of how memory and logic are structured in DSA, making it an ideal choice for understanding the internal working of algorithms and data structures.

##  How to Use

You can:
- Clone or download this repo
- Compile individual `.c` files using `gcc`:
  ```bash
  gcc arrays.c -o arrays
  ./arrays
